STDF4J

Java library for reading STDF files. Currently only v4/v4-2007 is supported.
Unfortunately, the main test cases have been removed due to proprietary data,
but the test class has been included for reference and can be updated to
use any example STDF with corresponding statistics. For our testing we used
an ascii dump of the STDF using libstdf (http://freestdf.sourceforge.net) to
get the statistics for the test files. A small sample file is included for
reference, but it is recommended that a real production file be verified
before using this library on a large scale with your data.


BUILDING

This project uses maven (http://maven.apache.org) for building:
mvn clean install

This will build the library and all tools.


TEST CASES

Test cases are likely to contain proprietary data. Under the 'testdata'
directory is a project called 'create-sample-file', which can be used
to create sample files to be used in test cases. This is how test data
distributed with the core stdf4j release is created to avoid issues with
proprietary data.


RELEASE

In theory the following should release a new version:
mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform

I have not been able to get that to work with googlecode, however, so
for now I have a specialized 'release' script in the current directory
to help with automating releases. You should be able to run this without
any arguments to create a new release. You will be prompted for the new
release version as well as the next development version. The released version
will be tagged in svn, but no files will be uploaded to googlecode. This
must still be done manually.

performance optimize:
1. change the ByteArray to singleton
2. new Float/Double to Float/Double.valueOf
3. change the  "new String(cbuf, 0, length).intern()" to new
String(data, offset, length, ASCII)
4. change the Arrays.copyOfRange to System.arraycopy

one 1.2G stdf file need 24s with "record.getData()" called,
after optimized, the time is 9s(test env, Windows 7, Java 1.8)
